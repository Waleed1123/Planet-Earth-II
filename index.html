                "Planet Earth II" is a British nature documentary series produced by the BBC. It is the sequel to the
                highly acclaimed "Planet Earth" series, which originally aired in 2006. "Planet Earth II" was first
                broadcast in 2016, and like its predecessor, it was narrated by Sir David Attenborough.

                The series consists of six episodes, each focusing on a different habitat: "Islands," "Mountains,"
                "Jungles," "Deserts," "Grasslands," and "Cities."
